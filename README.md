# Sets-and-Maps
CSC 330 Assignment 1: Sets/Maps

## Project description
Develop a menu-driven system that maintains a list of employees that pass through a gate system. The program should begin by reading the employee.txt file: a CSV (comma separated value) text file in which each line in the file represents an employee. The program will then create an Employee object for each record in the file, and load the Employee object into a Map that tracks their attendance. The program will continue by displaying a menu for the user.

A menu will then be displayed, allowing the user the following options:
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 1. Display | Display all employees in list in easy-to-read tabular format. |
| 2. Add employee | Get employee information from user and add to the Map. |
| 3. Search | Get EmployeeID input from the user and display the employee if they exist. |
| 4. Exit | Exit the menu. |

After performing the appropriate action, display a new menu and repeat until user selects the exit option.
